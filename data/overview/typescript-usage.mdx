# TypeScript Usage

Working with TypeScript can help you detect many errors via static analysis done
by the TypeScript compiler. TypeScript also improves the developer experience by
providing:

- Useful auto-completion in your IDEs.
- Ensuring the JSX attributes used are strongly typed.

## Usage Notes

### `connect`

To ensure that the properties you spread are strongly typed in your framework,
you'll need to import the `normalizeProps`.

**In React.js**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"
import { normalizeProps } from "@zag-js/react"

const Accordion = () => {
  const api = accordion.connect(state, send, normalizeProps)
  // ...
}
```

**In Vue.js**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"
import { normalizeProps } from "@zag-js/vue"

const Accordion = defineComponent({
  // ...
  setup() {
    // ...
    const apiRef = computed(() =>
      accordion.connect(state, send, normalizeProps),
    )
    // ...
  },
})
```

**In Solid.js**

```tsx
import * as accordion from "@zag-js/accordion"
import { normalizeProps } from "@zag-js/solid"

const Accordion = (props) => {
  // ...
  const api = createMemo(() => accordion.connect(state, send, normalizeProps))
  // ...
}
```
